How to start:

1.) Run the "game_engine.py" python program, with python 3. Make sure you are in the directory containing the audio folder and highscore.txt file.
2.) **For optimal gameplay, run in fullscreen terminal with horizontal width atleast 180 and vertical length atleast 80. These can be achieved with full screen terminal.** Otherwise, game does not work properly and there will be many glitches.
3.) Be sure that all the requirements in the requirements.txt file are present.

Controls:

Use W to jump, A to move left, D to move right and F for throwing fireballs(if you have the ability).

Features:

1.) The levels generated are random and offer unlimited playability. The enemies, ditches, bricks, coins, cakes and background mountains all generate randomly.
2.) As your score increases, so does the level of difficulty- the enemies move faster, the valleys become more frequent, and coins and cakes become less frequent.
3.) Everytime your level increases, a mighty dragon is spawned.
4.) After you die or quit, you can check out the top 10 highest scores of all time, and compare how you performed.
5.) The game has full sound and colour.
6.) There is a hidden cheat mode. But, playing in cheat mode disqualifies you from having your name in the highscore list.
7.) Eating a cake increases your height and makes you more powerful, and eating a cake while you are big gives you ability to throw fireballs.
8.) Collecting 100 coins gives you an extra life.
9.) To kill the dragon, you need to have the ability to throw fireballs. Luckily, the dragon always spawns with two cakes nearby.
10) You can increase your score by a variety of tasks, such as breaking bricks, collecting coins, killing enemies, eating cakes, etc.
11.) The scenery changes as you progress through the levels.
12.) The characters printed on the terminal are unicode characters, with added color.
13.) Level progression is non linear - it is more difficult to move from level 4 to level 5 as compared to moving from level 1 to level 2.
14.) Theoretically, the level genrated will be infinite - your score and level can increase indefinitely as long as you survive,
15.) 


The game is written in Python 3.5.
The code written follows the object oriented programming paradigm, and exhibits modularity, encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance,etc.
